  <p style = "font-size:18px;">I am a second year Ph.D. student in Prof. <a href = "http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/" target = "_blank", rel="nofollow">Jiawei Han</a>'s <a href="http://dm1.cs.uiuc.edu/" target = "_blank", rel="nofollow">Data Mining Group</a>, Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. </p> 

  <p style = "font-size:18px;">My research focuses on <b>constructing multi-faceted taxonomy from massive unstructured text corpora</b>, to facilitate semantic search and exploration of large domain-specific corpora. My works lay in the intersection of data mining, information retrieval, and natural language processing.</p>

  <p style = "font-size:18px;">Before going to UIUC, I got my bachelor degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, and was a member of <a href="http://english.seiee.sjtu.edu.cn/english/info/8338.htm" target = "_blank">IEEE Honor Class</a>.
