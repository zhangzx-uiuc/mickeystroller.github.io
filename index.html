  <p style = "font-size:18px;">I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in <a href = "http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/" target = "_blank", rel="nofollow">Prof. Jiawei Han</a>'s <a href="http://dm1.cs.uiuc.edu/" target = "_blank", rel="nofollow">Data Mining Group</a>, Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Prior to UIUC, I received my bachelor degree from <a href = "http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/" target = "_blank", rel="nofollow">Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a>, under the supervision of <a href = "http://iwct.sjtu.edu.cn/personal/xwang8/" target = "_blank", rel="nofollow">Prof. Xinbing Wang</a>, and I was a member of <a href="http://english.seiee.sjtu.edu.cn/english/info/8338.htm" target = "_blank">IEEE Honored Class</a>.
  </p> 

  <p style = "font-size:18px;">My research work lies in the intersection of <b>data mining</b> and <b>natural language processing</b>. Specifically, I focus on constructing multi-faceted taxonomies from unstructured text corpora, and utilizing constructed taxonomies to empower knowledge-centric applications. My proposed <b>data-driven approach</b>, without excessive human annotations, <b>progressively constructs, enriches, and explores multi-faceted taxonomies</b> by utilizing user-provided seed information as weak supervision and existing knowledge repositories as distant supervision.</p>
